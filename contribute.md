# Contributing

We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

When contributing to the repositories in OSPC, please first discuss the change you wish to make via issue,
email, or any other method with the owners of the repository before making a change. 

## Where to Start

The best place to start is taking a look at the [repositories](https://github.com/OpenSourceProtogenCollection) we have and deciding where you would like to help out. Whether you're a web developer, an Arduino geek, or a Linux extrordinare, there's always something that could use improving. 

Many of our repositories track issues and feature requests either through the Issues board or the Projects board, so check those places to see where improvements can be made.

If you don't have much programming experience but still want to help, our documentation could use a hand. Check out [our markdown guide](https://protogencollection.aerofur.nz/docs/developer/mastering-markdown) for details on how to format documentation.

## Reporting Issues

Please use our issue templates to report issues. This allows you to provide us all the info we need.

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can.
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

## Adding a New Implementation

Have a new way to control the matrices? Found a matrix you're looking to support, or a library that you feel some might prefer to use? If you have a new implementation that you think could benefit others, feel free to reach out to one of our main [contributors](https://protogencollection.aerofur.nz/contributors) about adding your project to our GitHub organization.
