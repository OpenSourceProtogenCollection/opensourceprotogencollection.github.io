# What We Do

We are a group of developers, fursuit makers and fursuiters that want to create easy-to-use and customizable setups for creating Protogen fursuits.

## What Is A Protogen?

Protogens are a custom species created by [Malice-Risu](https://www.furaffinity.net/user/malice-risu). They are biotechnical lifeforms, with nanite face visors and several displays on their bodies. They are the prototype version of the closed-species counterpart, Primagens.

## Why Are You Doing This?

Because we're evil, and we want to start the biotechnical world takeover.

In all seriousness, [JaredTamana](https://protogencollection.titusstudios.net/contributors#JaredTamana) started the OSPC because of a lack of open-source resources for fursuit makers to use to make Protogens. This led to a very small number of creators holding a majority of the business to create these suits. As much as we respect those makers, we believe anyone should be able to make these suits with little more effort than any other fursuit. The furry fandom is a place where everyone is encouraged to create, and when only a small subset of creators can do that effectively (i.e. due to a lack of programming knowledge) it goes against the spirit of furry.

We do this because we love the fandom, because we want to see more Protogen fursuits... and because it's fun for us!
