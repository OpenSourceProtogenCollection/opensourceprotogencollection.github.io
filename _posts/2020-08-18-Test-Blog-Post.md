# OpenControl
An Open Source Locomotive Control Chip for Garry's Mod built on Wiremod's Expression 2 Environment


## Scope

The scope of the OpenControl Project is to build a robust, light-weight and life-like simulation of a Locomotive, that is [Open Source](https://opensource.com/resources/what-open-source), Open to community contributions, and built by a group of diverse Developers.

## How it all works

**NOTE:** This explanation is *very* simplified.

## Traction

### DC Traction

The DC Traction system in OpenControl is built on Ohm's Law:

*Ohm's law states that the current through a conductor between two points is directly proportional to the voltage across the two points. Introducing the constant of proportionality, the resistance one arrives at the usual mathematical equation that describes this relationship:*
### *I* = (V/R)

Generator Field Current and the Speed of the Engine (RPM), determines the voltage of the generator.
For most US engines, this is normalised to 600VDC.

 * A Generator, is a motor running in reverse. When you apply a current to the windings of a motor, a magnetic field is induced in the armature of the motor. This magnetic field causes the armature to spin. *(simplified explanation)*.
If you run the motor in reverse, then you will induce a current in the motor windings.

*GIF provided from Wikipedia, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_motor#/media/File:Electric_motor.gif*

 * Back electromotive force (Back EMF, BEMF) is a voltage that appears in the opposite direction to current flow as a result of the motor's coils moving relative to a magnetic field.

Once we have the Voltage of the Generator, we apply this to the Traction Motors.

The Traction Motor Current is calculated by getting the Generator Voltage (at motor terminals), and subtracting the number of Parallel paths multiplied by the Back EMF of the Traction Motor, which increases linearly to the Speed of the Locomotive.

The final current is determined by dividing the Traction Motor Current by the Resistance of the Motor.
The Resistance of the motor is calculated using Ohm's Law, R = Motor Terminal Voltage divided by the Current.

### Dynamic Braking

This same principle is applied to the Dynamic Brakes.
However the Dynamic Brake Resistor Grid is connected in series with the Traction motors, this will pull power from the Traction Motors, slowing down the Locomotive.

The Dynamic Brake Resistor Grid Resistance is fixed (not including heat losses). OpenControl uses a 700 Amps Dynamic Base line, which is 0.923 Ohm's.

 * A resistor resists the current flow of a circuit, as if you were pushing water through a pipe, and had a smaller pipe at the end. The loss of *"flow"*, is converted from electrical energy into Heat energy. The more current you are *resisting*, the more heat is generated. Depending on the material the resistor is made out of, the resistance will lower as it heats up. The speed of this is dependant on the material.
 
OpenControl uses the Axle RPM, to calculate the voltage of the Traction Motor(s), as if it was a generator.
Then it uses the voltage and Ohm's Law to calculate the Current of the Dynamic Brakes.

The output of this will be a positive, and the code inverts the current output to a negative.

## Addressing the Elephant in the Room

The OpenControl project is in no way associated with RLC, PT Gamma, PT2, or other variants. OpenControl is solely based on community contributions. OpenControl is neither a re-built, edited, or rebranded version of RLC, nor is this project based on events, which is basing this entire project over "revenge" for said events

OpenControl is in no way associated with RLC, PT Gamma, PT2, or other variants. And is neither a re-built, edited, or rebranded version of RLC.
